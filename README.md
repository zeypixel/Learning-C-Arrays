This code is a practical and detailed demonstration of using arrays in C++, covering almost everything about C-style arrays and std::array from the <array> library.
It includes examples of:

Accessing and modifying elements (array[i] and array.at(i)).

Useful functions like: front(), back(), size(), max_size(), empty(), fill(), and swap().

Working directly with pointers via data().

Using traditional loops, range-based for loops, iterators, and reverse iterators.

Safe access with at() including an example of Exception Handling when the index is out of range.

A ready-made function print_array() to easily print array elements.

In short, this code is a comprehensive reference for learning modern array handling in C++ in a practical way.
